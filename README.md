Final GWC project


This project was made during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 2017. 
I worked with Sienna, Bianca, and Sabahat to create a website dedicated to environmental justice. 
You can view the website with this link:

It has also been featured on the Girls Who Code website:

And at the Girls Who Code x Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez event. (Sienna, Bianca, and I spoke at it!)
