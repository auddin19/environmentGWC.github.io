    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>Try to use less electricity and more natural light in homes. You can also use solar power. This way a family can save more on their electricity bills.
.</p>
    <p>Install recycling containers at the corner of every street for cans, paper and plastic etc. where a recycling truck can come and pick it every other day.
</p>
    <p>Use your own grocery bags instead of using plastic bags in the supermarket..</p> 
    <p>Try to walk or use bicycles rather than using fuel emitting vehicles i.e.car, motorbike etc.</p>
    <p>Use google docs and word documents and sign up for e-billing rather than using papers and help save trees.</p>
    <p>Try to use less air conditioning! You aren’t going to die if your house is four degrees above 70 degrees... The environment is getting exposed to more chlorofluorocarbons every day and it is destroying the ozone layer.
</p>
    <p>If you can, grow your own organic vegetables like tomatoes and lemons rather than buying from the supermarket. Or, produce from local farms, as the amount of pollution caused by transportation is less if you buy from farms nearby instead of the supermarket. Also, sometimes it even tastes better!</p>
    <p>Don’t waste food. If you really can’t eat it save it for the birds, for example foods like bread and nuts.</p>
    <p>Use rechargeable batteries, they save money and energy.</p>
    <p>Grow plants at home for a clean and healthy breathing environment while making the Earth green
      at the same time. It will help to keep the temperature stable.”Go Green!”</p>
    <p>Unsubscribe from all of the junk mail that you do not need anymore, It is a waste of paper.</p>
    <p>Try to get your magazines on an app or online. Most newspaper and magazine companies. </p>
    <p>Eat less meat and more vegetables, they are more healthy and saves animals likes cows who are also a source of dairy products.</p>
    <p>Don’t waste water, and keep the tap off when you’re brushing your teeth, or taking a shower.</p>
    <p>Plant flowers to attract bees for better pollination!</p>
    <p>Stop using pesticides.</p>
    <p>Use hand dryers instead of paper towels in public bathroom.</p>
    <p>Use old methods of drying clothes i.e. clothe strings instead of using laundry driers.
      (P.S. It won’t make your pajamas shrink!)</p>
    <p>Use more blankets during winter instead of keeping the heat extremely high.</p>
    <p>Use hybrid and electric cars.</p>
    <p>Turn off all electronic devices when not in use.</p>
    <p>Leave the natural places like the parks, lakes and the beaches like how you found them.
